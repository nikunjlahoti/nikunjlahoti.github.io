======================

This is my personal blog site. It uses the [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) templating engine to render the website. 
To write a new entry, all you have to do is create a new file under **_posts**.
Also, there is a disqus comment integration for all posts.

Before I start using this full time, I need to make some improvements to the UX.
