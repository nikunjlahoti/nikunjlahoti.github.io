So I was wondering what to do with the `bin` folder in the [github repository][cow-and-the-bull]. `Classes` typically may not be kept along with the source - as they can always be generated.

[Anshul Bahukhandi][bahu] recently made a good contribution.

I have added a picture in the assets. Check it out [here]({{site.url}}/assets/tp-picture.png).
