`github` has already become - The Destination (for the developers and the crackers. Think: [this][article1]). Its a long overdue and finally I am here. And so is my github.io blog. I really find the concept of using `jekyll` & `markdown` to create a static blog - very fascinating. I think for the same reasons I like the way the `hangouts` app shows you till-what-point-in-time-someone-has-read (if you compare that with `WhatsApp` for instance). 
`disqus` can keep a good track of the comments which may ever come.

I will try to post random stuff here and gradually move away from my Wordpress [blog][wordpress].
A lot has to be done here - in terms of beautification - and I will incrementally keep adding value to it.

If you still do not have a github.io blog, then a good place to start is the website [itself][github].
Additionally you can also fork [my site][mysite] and make changes to it.

{% highlight bash %}
jekyll serve -w
{% endhighlight %}
