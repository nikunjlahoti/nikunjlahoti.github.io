I experienced a lot of issues with [Hangouts](https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1660627?hl=en) and then resorted to [TeamViewer](http://teamviewer.com). 

I was absolutely blown away by the ease of connection and the stability of it.

TeamViewer is available for all my devices - Android, GNU/Linux, Windows - its brilliant!

Using TV, I could remote connect to a friend's machine and get my stuff from it with such a great ease and that too for _FREE_.
