Well as I promised myself, now I am running Mac OS X 10.6 - which got upgraded to 10.6.8 (after the combo update) - on VirtualBox on my Windows 8.1 box.
It wasn't a lot of effort.

VirtualBox contains an EFI mode but that doesn't work with Snow Leopard, so we need iBoot corresponding to the host processor (Haswell for me). Inject the 'Mac OS X SL ISO' in the CD Devices and press F5. It will detect the disk and you can boot from it. Later, format the VDI disk and install it successfully.

Issues faced:
1. Multibeast - which is supposed to inject a bootloader fails to work upon the next reboot no matter how I do it.
2. _About this mac_ crashes the current login and respawns it. I still need to figure out why from logs etc.
3. Video resolution isn't great on my 2K screen. A boot.plist file in the iBoot ISO may have to be modified to make that work.
4. When trying to free upgrade to Yosemite,  the App store tells me that it is only possible for a certain processors (which lists mine - so gotta fix that somehow by changing some plist or kext file)

Now I have also got the VirtualBox running XP, Windows 8.1, Linux Mint :)
So deep is my love for Virtualization that I keep going back to it. https://nikunjlahoti.wordpress.com/2010/06/16/wooing-mac-os-x-10-6-3/

In other news my laptop now has got Ubuntu and got the Wifi to work as well :)
