Well, Lenovo Y50-70 is an absolute beast. So much of fire power in one hood. Wow! I am very happy. I am going to start experimenting soon.
Things I plan to do:
1) Run Virtual Machines (my _bhabhi_ got me a Snow Leapord some time back and now it's finally time to tame it :D)
2) Play Games. A lot of them. And enter the world of dedicated graphics card.
